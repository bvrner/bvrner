## About me:

Just yet another person that likes computer science, math and coding, I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Mathematics at the University of Brasilia (UnB). </br>
Most of what I write I do out of curiosity or interest about the implementation of something and whether or not I would be able to achieve it.

The languages I feel the most confortable with are Rust, C++, Haskell, Clojure and Python but I also have some familiarity with Elixir, Scala, Kotlin and Java.

## Interests:

- Computer Graphics and Vision.
- Deep Learning.
- Audio and Image Processing (i.e Signal Processing).
- Theory of Computation.
- Cryptography.
- Abstract Algebra and Category Theory.

...and many others.
